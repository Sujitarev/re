    <p>CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including aspects such as the
        layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification
        of presentation characteristics, enable multiple HTML
        pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.
